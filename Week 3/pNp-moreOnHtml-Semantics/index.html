                <h4>What children bring to their parents</h4>
                <p>Children are a blessing to parents; they bring a smile to their faces. They are God-sent and sweet little bundles of joy. Every time a child is born into a family, they bring great joy to their parents. As parents watch over their little ones, they begin to smile, crawl, sit, walk and talk.</p>
