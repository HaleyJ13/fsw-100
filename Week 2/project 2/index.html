        <p>Choosing a dog can be exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time. After all, you're committing to care for a living, breathing being who will depend on you his entire life! When choosing a new dog, so many questions run through your mind: "What kind of dog should I get?" "What's the best dog breed for me?" "Will he be a good fit with my family?"

            The first step to being a responsible dog owner begins before you even bring home a dog. Thoughtfully and seriously assess your needs before making a decision, and you'll live long, happy lives together.</p><!--block-->

        <h4>Best Leash to Walk them with</h4>
        <!--block-->
        <span>While a plain old flat collar is fine for a dog who can walk calmly on a leash, sometimes, dog owners need a little extra help. Walking a dog with a harness, which can be used in conjunction with a collar, is often a more comfortable option. This is especially true for dogs who pull on leash for whom collars can place dangerous pressure on the fragile trachea. The right kind of harness can help to successfully master loose leash walking, especially if used alongside positive reinforcement training methods.</span>
