    <section>
    <p>Hello I am Savannah Harwell. I am proud to say that I was raised in the Temecula/Murrieta area since 1989, and now I am raising my own family in the wonderful valley. I am excited to share with you why living in the Temecula area is a wonderful place to call HOME. There are so many benefits to living in our area â€“ clean air, highly rated school districts, affordable homes, an abundance of great parks and open space to enjoy, and just a short drive to the beach, desert, and mountains. Having spent 8 years as a preschool teacher, I have built many strong relationships with families in our area. I know the importance of trust and communication. I believe in clear and open communication as well as being an agent who is proactive for the benefit of my clients. Achieving your real estate goals is my top priority. I look forward to working for you!</p>
